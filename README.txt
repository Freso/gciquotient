GCI Quotient
============

This script downloads Google Code-In (GCI) data.  This includes task
descriptions and claimed task instance data, including uploaded files.

Everything is stashed by default into a 'gci_data' subdirectory.
Tasks are stored in gci_data/tasks while instance data is saved into
per-instance subdirectories named according to timestamp and title.

  gci_data/
    tasks/ - contains all tasks in json format
    instances/ - contains all task instances
      DATE-TASK_NAME_-_ORG/ - contains a single task instance
        instance.txt - contains a text summary of the task
        instance.json - contains raw instance data
        activity.json - contains all comments and status changes
